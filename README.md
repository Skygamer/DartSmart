# COVFeed
## by DartSmart

### About the app:
COVFeed is a mobile application that serves as a semi-news platform. This app is for sharing the current scenario of an area/region by the doctors, nurses and the health-care workers of that region.

This app has a home page with two options:
1. Feed
2. login page

Feed: This has all the articles written by the doctors, nurses and the health-care workers.
Login page: This allows only the people related to the medical field to login into the app.

The login is regulated by:
1. A unique ID which only the health-care workers have. Our database haas a list of all the IDs.
2. Phone number verification through OTP.

One of the benefits of our app is that it will allow the health-care workers to share their experience and information they want common people to know.
Since only they are allowed to post on the app, there will be negligible spamming!
